# Free Steam Games Async API Spike

## Reason
This is a spike used for practice calling an api with async and await. I wanted to get a better grasp of how to make calls inside the component with asynchronous features.

## API
[Steam APIs](https://steamapis.com/docs) were used to get all the games from Steam and parse through them for the ones designated as free. ".env" file should have the following:
  ```dotenv
  REACT_APP_STEAM_KEY=api key from steam api
  ```
